# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker

![Design preview for the IP Address Tracker coding challenge](./screenshot.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The challenge was to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) is used. To generate the map [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) is used. The project was build with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

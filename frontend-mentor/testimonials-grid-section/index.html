					I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
					current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
					got every penny‚Äôs worth.
				</h2>
				<p>
					‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been
					looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
					amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
					found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
					weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
					completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as
					a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

					Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
					Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
					easy.
				</h2>
				<p>
					‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
					really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
					able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
					developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
					attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
					people. ‚Äù

				<h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
				<p>
					‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I
					needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
					programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
					student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
					The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
					hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
					project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
					next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve
					often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
					experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
					developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
